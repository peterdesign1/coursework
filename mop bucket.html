      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>A house will be practically inhabitable and unpleasant without proper cleaning and maintenance routine.
        Especially when it has to do with its floor! There should be frequent cleaning of its tiles and carpets
        to keep it shinny, clean and healthy; especially in homes where are kids and infants. The pictures above
        is â€œMop Bucket â€œ, and it soothes the purpose we described earlier.
      </p>
      <h2>Pros</h2>
      <p>The Mop Bucket unlike many I have seen before, has some cool distinguishing features.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>It has a triangular mop head which makes it easy to slide into hidden corners for effective cleaning.</li>
          <li>There is a pedal attached to the bucket which helps to spin and wingle the mop causing it to drain water
            pretty fast. This pedal can be
            conveniently pulled with the foot</li>
            <li>The length of the mop handle is adjustable. Depending on how tall or short the user is, it can be adjusted
            to give the user convience as
            he or she wont have to ben over.</li>
            <li>I also think the brown and red color of the mop bucket is to preserve it as against using a white colour which
            can get stained and makes the bucket more difficult to maintain </li>
            <li>The two corners of the bucket are slightly curve and sloppy. This will make it easy to drain water out of the bucket
            in cautious way.</li>
