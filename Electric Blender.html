      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Every home requires a good equipment for proper grinding and smoothing of some food items and vegetables
         to make tasty and delightful meals, and this electric blender is suitable for this.
      </p>
      <h2>Pros</h2>
      <p>I will commend this electric blender for its great design for a number of reasons.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              Itâ€™s aesthetically pleasing
          </li>
          <li>
              The plastic jug is 1.5l large. Meaning it can process a considerable amount of food items like tomotoes,
              pepper and even fruits at a given time.
          </li>
          <li>
              The Jug has a scale on the body for proper and accurate measurements
          </li>
          <li>
              This blender can be easily dissembled; include its stainless steel blades to aid proper washing, also,
              its overall components are dish washer friendly.
          </li>
          <li>
              It has an additional grinder attached with thicker and sharper blades, which helps to blend hard and
              dry spices, food, fruits, nuts and beans etc. </li>
